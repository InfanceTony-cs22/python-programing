what is function:
       In computer programming, a function is a named, reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks


Use of function:
       Promote Code Reusability: They allow you to define a block of code that can be executed multiple times with different inputs, reducing redundancy.
       Organize Code           : Functions help in structuring code by breaking it into modular, manageable parts, improving readability and maintainability.

Types of function:

Built-in Functions:
These are functions that are pre-defined in Python and come with the language. Examples include len(), print(), max(), and min().

User-Defined Functions:
Functions created by the programmer to perform a specific task. They are defined using the def keyword.

Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions):
Small, one-line functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are often used for short-term tasks.

Recursive Functions:
Functions that call themselves during their execution. Recursion is a technique where a function solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem.





Examples:

Built-in 

 text="Byte Bash Blitz"
 length_text=len(text)
 print(f"Length of the string is :{lenght_text}")


 User defined :
 1
def add_numbers(x, y):
    sum_result = x + y
    print(sum_result)

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input(" "))
add_numbers(num1, num2)
2
def big(x, y):
    if x > y:
        bigest = x
    else:
        bigest = y
    print(bigest)
    
num1 = float(input("nter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("enter the second number: "))
big(num1, num2)
3
def number():
    for num in range(1, 11):
        print(num)

number()
